"""
This module contains everything that a Bundle needs to function.

First it contains Bundle, which hold a variable amount of pages.
Second it contains the class for a Page, which is where we do all of our actual whiteboard
work. Something to note is that this module does not contain tools that the Page will
use, instead those will be in the Tool module.
